# Market Prophet

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock market trends by combining three key analyses: Technical, Fundamental, and Sentiment. The system employs a holistic approach, utilizing stock market indicators for Technical Analysis, regression models fine-tuned for Fundamental Analysis, and a custom algorithm for normalizing and aggregating results. The inclusion of Sentiment Analysis enhances the predictive power, creating a robust framework for forecasting stock movements.

## Features

- **Technical Analysis:** Incorporates various stock market indicators and metrics for understanding historical price movements and trends.
  
- **Fundamental Analysis:** Utilizes regression models, fine-tuned with historical financial data, to evaluate a company's intrinsic value and growth potential.

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrates sentiment analysis on news articles, social media, and financial reports to gauge market sentiment and its impact on stock prices.

- **Normalization Algorithm:** A proprietary algorithm designed from scratch to normalize and aggregate results from both Technical and Fundamental analyses, ensuring a unified and consistent prediction model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow (for machine learning components)
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for Sentiment Analysis
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
